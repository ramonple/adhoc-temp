background: 
Following the segmentation change in November 2025, BQ0 revolving customers with requested amounts below £2,500 were classified into a specific segment. 
The current objective is to introduce targeted risk controls for this group. 

Given the immaturity of post-implementation performance data, 
an initial validation check was conducted to assess whether first spend below £2,500 can be used as a reliable and conservative proxy for requested amount below £2,500.


Section 1: Proxy Validation

To validate whether first spend below £2,500 can be used as a proxy for requested amount below £2,500, 
I used post-implementation data only, so that we’re not mixing definitions or behaviours across different policy regimes.

I started with a volume overview, just to understand data coverage and any structural limitations. 
In total, we have 4,453 accepted new applications post-implementation. 
Of these, around 4,155 have a recorded requested amount, meaning roughly 7% are missing request amount. 
This is expected and largely driven by applications prior to early December, where referred cases did not consistently capture the requested amount field.

From there, I looked at drawdown behaviour. 
Out of the accepted population, around 3,000 accounts have an observed first spend, so approximately 27% have not yet drawn down. 
That’s important context, because any analysis involving first spend necessarily conditions on customer behaviour after account opening.

Using the subset with both requested amount and first spend observed, I then ran two validation checks.
The first was a population overlap analysis, where I cross-classified customers by requested amount band and first spend band. 
The results show very strong alignment — around 93% of customers requesting below £2,500 also first spend below £2,500. 
The small degree of misclassification is limited and directionally conservative, meaning the proxy slightly over-captures risk rather than missing it.

The second step was a risk behaviour comparison. 
I compared key risk indicators, including the theoretical bad rate at application and RN and indebetendss score.
Across all these metrics, the risk ordering and magnitude are consistent between customers defined by requested amount and those defined by first spend, with no material divergence.

Based on these two checks together — volume alignment and risk behaviour consistency — 
the conclusion from this first section is that first spend below £2,500 is a reasonable and conservative proxy for requested amount below £2,500. 
This gives us the confidence to back-track pre-implementation data, 
significantly increase sample size, and move on to the main part of the project, which is designing targeted risk controls for this segment.
